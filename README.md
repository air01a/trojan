trojan
======

Home made trojan/virus (c/c++)

I wrote this program for pentesting purpose (work) in 2003. There is included protection against antimalware detection, and it's funny to see that more than ten years later, some antivirus still can not detect it !

There is no documentation at all, and I've lost the webadministration part (oups), so this soft is unusable (and that's why I opened this git repository). I'am not sure you can still compile this software.
I've put it online only for educational purpose, don't use it for anything else...
